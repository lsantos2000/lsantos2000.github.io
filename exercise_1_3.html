	  <h2 id="exercise-1-3-objectives">Objectives</h2>
	  
	  <p>To showcase how to automate a network intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system in a security environment, this lab will
      take you through managing a Snort IDS instance. Snort analyzes network traffic and compares it against some given rule set. In this lab,
      Snort is installed on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine and Ansible interacts with it by accessing the RHEL node over SSH.</p>
	  
      <h2 id="step-1---snort">Step 1 - Snort</h2>
	  
      <p>Before we show you some actual QRadar Incident Remediation using Ansible, we want to inroduce you to Snort, 
	  one of the most used Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDP) systems out there.</p>
	  
	  <strong>What is Snort?</strong>
	  <p>Snort is a free open source network intrusion detection system and intrusion prevention system created in 1998 by Martin Roesch, 
	  founder and former CTO of Sourcefire. Snort is now developed by Cisco, which purchased Sourcefire in 2013.</p>
	  
	  <strong>Installing Snort into the Operating System</strong>
      <p>In our Lab, Snort has been installed and setup for you. If you want to use your own version of the image, you need to install Snort 
	  into the operating system or virtual machine of your choice. To install the latest version of Snort, you can follow the installation
      instruction from the Snort website. Note that installation instructions are vary from OSes. e.g. the instruction below shows how to 
	  install snort from its source code on Linux.</p> 	 
	  
	  <p><img src="./images/snort-install.png" alt="Snort Install Instructions"></p>  
	  
	  <p>You can find more information here: <a href="https://www.snort.org/#get-started" target="_blank">Snort Get Started</a>
	  
	  <p>While you install the snort, you system may miss some libraries. You need to install the required libraries, too.</p>	   
	  
      <h2 id="step-2---accessing-the-snort-server">Step 2 - Accessing the Snort server</h2>
      <p>In order to connect to the Snort installation, we need to to find the IP address of the machine it is installed on. You can then get
      the IP address of the Snort machine by looking up the information on the inventory file <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/lab_inventory/hosts</code>. In your VS Code online editor, in the menu bar click on
      <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Open File…</strong> and open the file <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/student&lt;X&gt;/lab_inventory/hosts</code>. Search and find the entry for snort which looks
      like this:</p>
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>snort <span class="nv">ansible_host</span><span class="o">=</span>22.333.44.5 <span class=
          "nv">ansible_user</span><span class="o">=</span>ec2-user <span class="nv">private_ip</span><span class="o">=</span>172.16.1.2
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
        <p>The IP addresses here are for demo purposes and will be different in your case. You have your own dedicated Snort setup in your
        individual lab environment.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Once you find the IP address, it’s time to access the Snort server. The connection uses a SSH key pre-installed on the control host,
      the user for the Snort server is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ec2-user</code>. In your VS Code online editor, open
      a terminal and access the snort server via:</p>
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">[</span>student&lt;X&gt;@ansible ~]<span class="nv">$ </span>ssh ec2-user@22.333.44.5

      <h2 id="step-3---simple-snort-rules">Step 3 - Simple Snort rules</h2>
      <p>In the most basic capacity, Snort works by reading some rules and acting according to them. In this lab, we will be working with some
      simple examples of Snort in order to show how to automate this configuration with Ansible. This session is not designed to dive into the
      specifics of Snort rules and the complexity involved in large setups, however, it is helpful to understand the basic structure of a
      simple rule so that you are aware of what you are automating.</p>
      <p>A rule consists of a rule header and rule options and is saved in files.</p>
      <p>The Snort rule header breaks down into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an action</li>
        <li>the protocol to look for like TCP</li>
        <li>source information like IP and port</li>
        <li>destination information like IP and port</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Snort rule options are keywords separated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> and can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>messages to output when a rule matches</li>
        <li>SID, a unique identifier of the rule</li>
        <li>content to search for in the packet payload, for example a suspicious string</li>
        <li>or byte tests to check for binary data</li>
        <li>a revision of the rule</li>
        <li>the severity of the attack, called “priority”</li>
        <li>a pre-defined attack type called “classtype” to better group the rule with other rules</li>
        <li>and others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Not all options are mandatory, some also only override existing default values.</p>
      <p>A Snort rule’s outline is as follows:</p>
      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code>[action][protocol][sourceIP][sourceport] -&gt; [destIP][destport] ( [Rule options] )
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>If you want to learn more about Snort rules, check out the <a href="https://www.snort.org/documents/snort-rule-infographic">Snort Rule
      Infographic</a> or dive into the <a href="https://www.snort.org/documents/snort-users-manual">Snort Users Manual (PDF)</a>. If you want
      to have a look at some real Snort rules you can also access the Snort installation in your lab and look at the content of the
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/snort/rules</code> directory.</p>
      <h2 id="step-3---example-playbook">Step 4 - Example playbook</h2>
      <p>As discussed earlier, Ansible automation is described in playbooks. Playbooks consist of tasks. Each task uses a module and the
      module’s corresponding parameters to describe the change that needs to be done or the state that is desired.</p>
      <p>Ansible releases are shipped with a set of modules, however, in Ansible 2.9 there are no modules to interact with Snort yet. For this
      reason we wrote a set of modules for managing Snort. This way, we can provide value without having to wait for a new Ansible release.
      Also, we are able to update our modules faster. This is especially important in the early life of a newly developed module.</p>
      <p>These Snort modules are shipped as part of a “role”. To better describe a role, think about how you wrote your playbook in the last
      section. While it is possible to write a playbook in one file as we did earlier, often writing all automation pieces in one place results
      in creating long, complicated playbooks. At some point you will want to reuse the automation content you wrote in your playbooks already.
      Therefore, you will need to organize things in a way to get multiple smaller playbooks to work together. Ansible Roles are the way we
      achieve this. When you create a role, you deconstruct your playbook into parts and those parts sit in a directory structure.</p>
      <p>There are multiple advantages in using roles to write your automation. The most notable is that the complexity and playbook
      intelligence is hidden from the user. The other important advantage is that roles can be easily shared and re-used.</p>
      <p>Back to the Snort use case: as mentioned, the Snort modules are shipped as part of a role. This role is called <a href=
      "https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule">ids_rule</a>. Open the Github repository link in the web browser, click on the <a href=
      "https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule/tree/master/library">library</a> path. You will find the module <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snort_rule.py</code> there. This module shipped as a part of the ids_rule role, can create and
      change snort rules.</p>
      <p>If you take a closer look at the role you’ll see that it comes with a re-usable playbook at <a href=
      "https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule/blob/master/tasks/snort.yml">tasks/snort.yml</a>.</p>
      <p>Let’s have a look at how this playbook can be re-written to use the roles directly. To do this, we first need to download and install
      the role on our control host. There are several ways to do this but a very convenient way is the command line tool <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ansible-galaxy</code>. This tool installs roles directly from the archives, Git URLs and from
      <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/">Ansible Galaxy</a>. Ansible Galaxy is a community hub for finding and sharing Ansible content. It
      provides features like rating, quality testing, proper searching and so on. For example, the role mentioned above can be found in Ansible
      Galaxy at <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible_security/ids_rule">ansible_security/ids_rule</a>.</p>
      <p>On the command line, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ansible-galaxy</code> tool to download and
      install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ids_rule</code> role with a single command. Execute the following command
      in a terminal of your VS Code online editor:</p>
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">[</span>student&lt;X&gt;@ansible ~]<span class="nv">$ </span>ansible-galaxy <span class=
          "nb">install </span>ansible_security.ids_rule
- downloading role <span class="s1">&#39;ids_rule&#39;</span>, owned by ansible_security
- downloading role from https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule/archive/master.tar.gz
- extracting ansible_security.ids_rule to /home/student&lt;X&gt;/.ansible/roles/ansible_security.ids_rule
- ansible_security.ids_rule <span class="o">(</span>master<span class="o">)</span> was installed successfully
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>As you see the role is installed to the roles default path, <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ansible/roles/</code>.It was prefixed by <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ansible_security</code>, this is the name of the project used for security roles, such as what we
      are using in this lab.</p>
      <p>Now that we have the role installed on our control host, we can use it in a playbook. In order to use the role, create a new file
      called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_snort_rule.yml</code> in your VS Code online editor. Save it in the home
      directory of your user, and add the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add Snort rule</code> and target hosts, here
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snort</code>. Since we need root rights to make any changes on Snort, add the
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">become</code> flag so that Ansible would take care of privilege escalation.</p>
      <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Add Snort rule</span>
  <span class="na">hosts</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">snort</span>
  <span class="na">become</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">yes</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Next we need to add the variables required by our playbook. The role we are using is written in a way that can work with multiple IDS
      providers, all the user needs to provide is the name of the IDS and the role will take care of the rest. Since we are managing a Snort
      IDS, we need to set the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ids_provider</code> variable to <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snort</code>.</p>
      <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Add Snort rule</span>
  <span class="na">hosts</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">snort</span>
  <span class="na">become</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">yes</span>

  <span class="na">vars</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">ids_provider</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">snort</span>
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Next, we need to add the tasks. Tasks are the components which make the actual changes on the target machines. Since we are using a
      role, we can simply use a single step in our tasks, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include_role</code>, to add it to
      our playbook. In order to make the role suitable for our use case, we add the following task-specific variables:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the actual rule</li>
        <li>the Snort rules file</li>
        <li>the state of the rule, present or absent</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">

</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Let’s have a quick look at what is happening here. the rule header is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alert tcp any
      any -&gt; any any</code>, so we create an alert for tcp traffic from any source to any destination. The rule options define the human
      readable Snort message if and when the rule finds a match. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uricontent</code> which is
      a specialized version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content</code> making it easier to analyze URIs. The
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">classtype</code> is set to <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attempted-user</code> which is the default class for “attempted user privilege gain”. SID is set
      to a value high enough for user defined rules. The priority is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> and finally
      since this is the first version of this rule we set the revision to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>.</p>
      <p>The other variables, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ids_rules_file</code> and <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ids_rule_state</code> provide the user defined location for the rules file and state that the rule
      should be created if it does not exist already (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present</code>).</p>
      <h2 id="step-5---run-the-playbook">Step 5 - Run the playbook</h2>

      <p>As you can see when you run this playbook, there are many tasks executed in addition to adding the rules. For instance, the role
      reloads the Snort service after the rule is added. Other tasks ensure that the variables are defined and verified. This yet again
      highlights the value of using roles. By taking advantage of roles, you are not only making your content re-usable but you can also add
      verification tasks and other important steps and keep them neatly hidden inside the role. The users of the role do not need to know the
      specifics of how Snort works in order to use this role as part of their security automation.</p>	  
	  
      <h2 id="step-6---verify-changes">Step 6 - Verify changes</h2>
	  
      <p>A quick way to check if the rules were written correctly is to SSH to the Snort server and look for the content of the <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/snort/rules/local.rules</code> file.</p>
      <p>Another way is to use Ansible on our control host. To do this we use a different role to verify if a Snort rule is in place. This role
      searches and finds existing rules in Snort and is called <a href="http://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule_facts">ids_rule_facts</a>.
      To use this role, as we did previously, we install it using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ansible-galaxy</code>:</p>
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">[</span>student&lt;X&gt;@ansible ~]<span class="nv">$ </span>ansible-galaxy <span class=
          "nb">install </span>ansible_security.ids_rule_facts
- downloading role <span class="s1">&#39;ids_rule_facts&#39;</span>, owned by ansible_security
- downloading role from https://github.com/ansible-security/ids_rule_facts/archive/master.tar.gz
- extracting ansible_security.ids_rule_facts to /home/student1/.ansible/roles/ansible_security.ids_rule_facts
- ansible_security.ids_rule_facts <span class="o">(</span>master<span class="o">)</span> was installed successfully
</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>In our VS Code online editor, we create a playbook, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify_attack_rule.yml</code>
      to use it. Set the name of the playbook to something like “Verify Snort rule”. The values for hosts, the IDS provider variable and the
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">become</code> flag can be set to the same as in our previous playbook.</p>
      <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Verify Snort rule</span>

</code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Next, we import the role <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ids_rule_facts</code>. We also need to provide a search
      string to identify the rule we are looking for. In our example, considering the rule we have created, it makes sense to use the
      <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uricontent</code> rule option for this purpose.</p>
      <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>And most importantly, we want to be able to see what is actually found. The <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ids_rule_facts</code> stores the data it collects as Ansible facts. Ansible facts are information
      specific to each individual host which can be used in further tasks. Therefore, we add another task to output these facts.</p>

      <p>The last task outputs the rule which was found by the role. As you can see, it is the rule we previously added.</p>
      <p>Congratulations! You have completed the first steps of automating Snort with Ansible. Head back to the exercise overview and continue
      with the next step.</p>
	  
	  
      <h2 id="step-7">Additional Playbooks - adding more Snort Rules</h2>
	  
      <p>Below we show you some other useful playbooks that will add more rules to <code class=
      "language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/snort/rules/local.rules</code> file.</p>
      
	  <p><strong>Add new Snort signature for NMAP TCP XMAS SCAN</strong></p>
	  
	  <p>Identify NMAP XMAS Scan: as we know that TCP communication follows three-way handshake to established TCP connection with target machine but 
	  sometimes instead of using SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK flag attacker choose XMAS scan to connect with the target by sending data 
	  packets through Fin, PSH & URG flags. Let assume attacker may choose XMAS scanning for network enumeration then in that 
	  situation we can apply the following rule in snort local rule file.</p>

	  <p><strong>Add new Snort signature for NMAP TCP SCAN</strong></p>
	  
      <p>Identify NMAP TCP Scan: now in order to connect with the target network, an attacker may go for networking enumeration either using TCP Protocol 
	  or UDP protocol. Let’s assume attacker may choose TCP scanning for network enumeration then in that situation we can apply 
	  the following rule in snort local rule file.</p>
